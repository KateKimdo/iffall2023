            <h2>What is Newtro?</h2>
            <p>"Newtro" is a term that combines "new" and "retro" and refers to a design style or cultural trend that blends modern elements with nostalgic or vintage aesthetics, creating a unique and familiar yet contemporary look and feel.</p>
            <h2>Popularization and history</h2>
            <p>The Newtro trend in South Korea, driven by a shift in the 30 to 50 age group, includes TV shows, nostalgic snacks, and vintage designs. Period dramas set in the late 20th century have played a role, appealing to audiences both in South Korea and abroad. Newtro bridges generational gaps and is likely to persist due to its flexibility for fresh content, offering a retreat to simpler times amidst modern challenges and nostalgia.</p>
