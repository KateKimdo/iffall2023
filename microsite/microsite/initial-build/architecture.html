            <h2>Hanok</h2>
            <p>Newtro has revived the traditional Korean Hanok architecture and style in contemporary times. Hanok, originating in the 14th century during the Joseon dynasty, remains appealing in modern South Korea, leading to the integration of Hanok's characteristic features into modern living spaces.</p>

            <h2>Korean cafe</h2>
            <p>Many cafes now incorporate retro-inspired decor, known as Hanok or Dabang style, maintaining traditional exteriors with modern interiors. Retro-style arcades have also adopted the Newtro aesthetic, offering games from the 80s and 90s, while areas like Eulji-ro in downtown Seoul combine historical and industrial elements, transforming traditional buildings into modern eateries and bakeries.</p>
