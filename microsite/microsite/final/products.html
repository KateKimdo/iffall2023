                <p>Newtro culture has brought back retro packaging and redesigns to various food and drink products.</p>

                <p>One company has re-launched a type of noodles 30 years after they were originally on the market. Old time snacks have also made a comeback; snacks like Samyang's Star Popeye snack, Lotte's Juicy & Fresh Gum, Lotte's Cheetos, Gompyo's popcorn and Gompyo's nachos.</p>
                    
                <p>Gompyo, also redesigned their beer packaging with 90s elements and used their original logo due to Newtro culture. Jinro soju bottle released their previous version of 1970s & 1980s and since its released in April; sales of those have hit like over 100 million units in 7 months. 70s version of Soju (Kumbokju's Soju King, Muhak and Jinro) have made their comeback with original packaging, logos and taste. The old transparent bottle caught up fast as the younger generation prefers them more than the current Soju coming in green bottles. One beer company has used its old bear character (used back in 1950s) and retro style fonts on its packaging.
