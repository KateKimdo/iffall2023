                <h2><strong>Newtro: where "New" meets "Retro"</strong></h2>
                <p>Newtro is an amalgamation of trends of the modern and retro eras (namely, the 1980s and 1990s) in all fields of life, such as fashion, music, movies, beverages, food, architecture, electronics, etc. Newtro is not only a nostalgic pass-time aimed for middle aged but also a source of entertainment for the younger generation. This aspect is very different from the standard retro (which is simply recreating the objects from the past). Newtro is presented by modern sense (i.e. interpretation, not representation).<br>

                This culture rose to popularity in South Korea in the year 2019, and is still popular today.</p>
