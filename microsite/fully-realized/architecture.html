                <p>Newtro has bolstered the historical Hanok architecture and style in the modern age.</p>

                    <p>Hanok is the traditional Korean housing built and designed in the 14th century during the Joseon dynasty. In the modern times, with the fast-changing Korea, Hanok has not lost its appeal, which lead to the incorporation of certain characteristic features of Hanok into modern homes and living spaces.</p>
                    
                    <p>Many cafes are incorporating retro-inspired decors and furniture, often called Hanok (Hangul: 한옥) or a cafe/Dabang (Hangul: 다방). More Dabang (traditional Korean coffee houses) styled cafes are appearing in cities. Most Hanok cafes maintain the external appearance and general structure of a traditional Hanok, while still having modern interiors</p>

                <p>Retro style arcades have also adapted the Newtro look. Nintendo and Tencent have both released games that feature their retro jasses. Kom Kom Arcade gives an option to play games from the 80s and 90s, and the arcade is seen in the K-drama When the Camellia Blooms.</p>

                    <p>Eulji-ro Korean: downtown Seoul, named after the general Eulji Mundeok (Hangul: 을지문덕) offers an industrial, historical taste of Korea with historical machine and tool shops, printing shops, and traditional houses being renovated into restaurants which store a mix of traditional interior design with modem eateries and bakeries.</p>
