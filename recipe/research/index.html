        <h1>Description</h1>
        <p>A popular street food from the 1960s and 1970s that’s been brought to international attention with Netflix’s new Korean drama, Squid Game, dalgona candy (also known as ppopgi), is a sweet but nutty candy that your kids will love to snack on.</p>

        <h1>Ingredients</h1>

        <h2>sugar</h2>
        <p>while you can use either brown sugar or white sugar to make this candy recipe, I use white sugar. It’s easier to see the color of the sugar changing with white sugar.</p>
        <h2>Baking soda</h2>
        <p>you cannot skip the baking soda. The baking soda reacts to the sugar and turns it light, airy, and brittle.</p>

        <h1>Dalgona tools</h1>

        <h2>stainless steel ladle</h2>
        <h2>wooden chopstick</h2>

        <h1>Instructions</h1>

        <h2>1.</h2>
        <p>Gather all your tools and ingredients. Lightly oil and sugar a flat metal spatula. Add the sugar to the stainless steel ladle and hold over medium low heat.
        
        <h2>2.</h2>
        <p>Let the sugar melt along the edges until it’s clear, then stir with a wooden chopstick, until the sugar is melted and starts to caramelize. The sugar should be clear and lightly amber.</p>
       
        <h2>3.</h2>
        <p>Move the ladle off the heat and stir in the baking soda, quickly until it starts to foam and turn a light caramel color. Move the ladle between on and off the heat to keep it warm.</p>
        
        <h2>4.</h2>
        <p>Pour the candy onto a parchment paper lined baking sheet.</p>
        
        <h2>5.</h2>
        <p>Let cool for 10-20 seconds and then press with the sugared spatula to the desired thickness.</p>
        
        <h2>6.</h2>
        <p>Stamp with a cookie cutter part of the way through. Let cool until firm and crunch and enjoy!</p>

            <p>The images help the user with visualizing the steps for making the candy. The tips and tricks part is also very useful as making dalgona requires great timing and some luck.</p>
        
            <h2> Recipe from <a href= "https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/food-network-kitchen/dalgona-candy-11186873">Food Network</a></h2>
            <p>The steps are laid out very clearly with the numberings but it lacks visual aid.</p>
        
            <h2> Recipe from <a href= "https://iamafoodblog.com/dalgona-candy/">I am food blog</a></h2>
            <p>Stephanie's recipe has a great balance between the images and the text, which makes it clear and easy for the user to follow along. The sections are also very well divided so that the users can understand what step they are in and what ingredients they need.</p>
