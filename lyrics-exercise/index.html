            <h2 class="firstparagraph">[Verse 1]</h2>

             <p>Master manipulator <br>
                God, you're so good at what you do<br>
                Come for me like a savior<br>
                And I'd put myself through hell for you<br>
                Hear all the rumors lately<br>
                That you always denied<br>
                And I fell for you like water<br>
                Falls from the February sky<br>
                But now the current's stronger<br>
                No, I couldn't get out if I tried<br>
                But you convinced me, baby<br>
                It was all in my mind<br>
                </p>

            <h2 class="firstparagraph">[Chorus]</h2>

            <p> And now you got me thinkin'<br>
                Two plus two equals five<br>
                And I'm the love of your life<br>
                'Cause if rain don't pour and sun don't shine<br>
                Then changing you is possible<br>
                No, love is never logical<br>
                </p>

            <h2 class="firstparagraph">[Verse 2]</h2>

            <p>You built a giant castle<br>
                With walls so high I couldn't see<br>
                The way it all unraveled<br>
                And all the things you did to me<br>
                You lied, you lied, you lied, oh<br>
            </p>

            <h2 class="firstparagraph">[Chorus]</h2>

            <p>And now you got me thinkin'<br>
                Two plus two equals five<br>
                And I'm the love of your life<br>
                'Cause if rain don't pour and sun don't shine<br>
                Then changing you is possible<br>
                I guess love is never logical<br>
                The sky is green, the grass is red<br>
                And you mean all those words you said<br>
                I'm sure that girl is really your friend<br>
                Our problems are all solvable<br>
                'Cause loving you is loving every<br>
            </p>

            <h2 class="firstparagraph">[Bridge]</h2>

            <p>Argument you held over my head<br>
                Brought up the girls you could have instead<br>
                Said I was too young, I was too soft<br>
                Can't take a joke, can't get you off<br>
                Oh, why do I do this?<br>
            </p>

            <h2 class="firstparagraph">[Chorus]</h2>

            <p>I look so stupid thinkin'<br>
                Two plus two equals five<br>
                And I'm the love of your life<br>
                'Cause if rain don't pour and sun don't shine<br>
                Then changing you is possible (Ah, ah)<br>
                No, love is never logical<br>
            </p>

            <h2 class="firstparagraph">[Outro]</h2>

            <p>Logical, logical<br>
                Love is never logical<br>
                I know I'm half responsible<br>
                And that makes me feel horrible<br>
                Oh, logical, logical<br>
                Love is never logical<br>
                I know I could've stopped it all<br>
                God, why didn't I stop it all?<br>
                Oh, logical, logical<br>
                Love is never logical<br>
                I know I'm half responsible<br>
                And that makes me feel horrible<br>
                Oh, logical, logical<br>
                Love is never logical<br>
                I know I could've stopped it all<br>
                God, why didn't I stop it all?<br>
