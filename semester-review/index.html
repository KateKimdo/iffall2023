					<h2>Recipe Page</h2>
					<p>I designed a recipe page in creating a Dalgona candy, which became famous after being on the show, Squid Game. This is a personal favorite candy that contains so many memories of when I was young, buying this candy everyday after school. This was my first time creating a website out of scratch, which was both an interesting and great learning experience. I am very happy with how it turned out with just basic information but with responsive elements that can be viewed on my phone screen.</p>

					<h2>Microsite - Designer, Developer</h2>
					<p>With the direction from my Creative director, Laura Weil, I was able to create a website with the topic of Newtro. I have never knew what Newtro was until I was given with this topic even though I am Korean, which was a great experience of getting to know my culture even more. It was quite a struggle creating navigation bar and different html pages for the first time, but I am proud of how it came through and I had so much fun with it.</p>

					<h2>Microsite - Creative Director</h2>
					<p>Frank Ocean was and is my favorite artist due to his aesthetic album designs and songs. When I was given to direct Lynn about this project, I made sure that the website followed the aesthetic of Frank Ocean and contained spotify playlists that the viewers can see. As it was Lynn's first time doing html, it was difficult to create some elements that I expected, which was a barrier, but I am glad how Lynn incorporated all the essential elements to the website with consistency.</p>
